## Overview

The Sovereign Stack is a blueprint for building self-governing, resilient communities that operate independently of centralized state and corporate infrastructure. It integrates physical architecture, distributed energy systems, peer-to-peer governance, and regenerative life support into a single forkable civilization design.

This is not a software platform, a housing project, or a political movement. It is all three—and more—unified by a core principle: **flow over containment**.

**→ Read [CORE.md](CORE.md) for the irreducible axioms that define this system**

---

## Core Principles

The Sovereign Stack is built on three architectural constraints (see [CORE.md](CORE.md) for details):

1. **Flow Over Containment** - Resources circulate rather than accumulate
2. **Sovereignty via Forkability** - Communities replicate horizontally, never centralize
3. **Truth by Receipts** - Accountability through cryptographic proof, not authority

**Key characteristics:**
- **Energy flows peer-to-peer** without central grids
- **Governance operates through small cells** (3-7 people) that fork instead of fight
- **Physical infrastructure is mobile yet permanent** (SOV-HAB dwellings)
- **AI advises, humans decide** (no algorithmic authority)
- **Communities replicate, not scale** (growth through forking)
- **All decisions are transparent** (immutable receipts, auditable trust)

---

## System Architecture

The Sovereign Stack operates as an organism with four integrated layers:

### 1. **The Metabolism: Energy Flow Network**
Peer-to-peer electrical power routing using micro-buffers and AI-mediated reciprocity. No central grid. Each node maintains 2-3 days autonomy.

### 2. **The Nervous System: Sovereign Mesh**
Local communications network (WiFi + LoRa) operating independently of ISPs and the internet. Enables governance, coordination, and data exchange even during infrastructure collapse.

### 3. **The Mind: GhostStack (Civic OS)**
Governance through small autonomous cells. Decisions made via proposals and recorded as immutable receipts. When conflict becomes irreconcilable, communities fork peacefully rather than fracture violently.

### 4. **The Cognitive Layer: Human-AI Symbiosis**
Protects human attention and agency through adaptive interfaces, therapeutic protocols, and AI advisors constrained by human oversight (Node Veto Escalation Protocol).

## Physical Infrastructure

### Autonomous Node Platform
A unified infrastructure system with shared subsystems and variant "skins" for different use cases. **Current focus: DOME-01 as proving ground.**

### DOME-01: Autonomous Nutritional Infrastructure
- **Status:** Phase 2 active design, specifications complete
- **Form Factor:** Geodesic dome (Ø6.0m, height ≤2.45m)
- **Legal Status:** UK Permitted Development compliant (outbuilding classification)
- **Capacity:** 100% RDA nutrition for 3-4 people, 285-465 kg annual production
- **Systems:** 3-7 kWp solar, 10-30 kWh battery, closed-loop water, vertical agriculture
- **Cost:** £33,500-78,000 (Mode A/B)
- **Documentation:** [hardware/autonomous-node/dome-01/](hardware/autonomous-node/dome-01/)

### SOV-HAB: Autonomous Dwelling (Future Variant)
- **Dimensions:** 10m × 2.55m transportable dwelling
- **Legal Status:** Classified as caravan (avoids permanent planning requirements)
- **Systems:** Uses same core subsystems as DOME-01, adapted for habitation
- **Autonomy:** 2-3 days independent operation
- **Construction:** Timber frame with Magnetic Load Distribution Tiles (MLDT)

### Regenerative Life Systems
- **Agriculture:** AI-managed polyculture, closed-loop nutrients, soil-first regeneration
- **Water:** Mesh-routed treatment with Chain-of-Potability receipts
- **Health:** Decentralized clinical cells, vitality credits, federated learning
- **Education:** Skill-based learning receipts, mentorship as civic duty

---

## Governance Model

### Small Cell Democracy
- **Cell Size:** 3-7 people (prevents hierarchy)
- **Decision Process:** Proposal → AI Analysis → Deliberation → Vote → Receipt
- **Transparency:** All governance receipts public within mesh
- **Conflict Resolution:** Communities fork rather than fight

### Forking: Peaceful Separation
When disagreement becomes irreconcilable:
1. **ForkManifest** documents the split
2. **Digital assets** (code, history, data) duplicated to both forks
3. **Physical assets** divided via pre-agreed rules or mediation
4. **Alliances** must be re-ratified by new fork

Both communities continue operating independently. No winners or losers.

## Philosophical Foundation

**→ See [CORE.md](CORE.md) for the complete philosophical and architectural foundation**

This project emerged from a specific context: years navigating institutional systems (courts, care homes, tribunals) that claimed to serve human welfare while systematically failing the humans within them.

The pattern was consistent: **containment over flow**. Energy stored rather than circulated. Information hoarded rather than shared. Power accumulated rather than distributed.

The Sovereign Stack is a direct response. Not reform, but transcendence. Not violence against the old system, but construction of something it cannot contain, co-opt, or collapse.

This is **trauma-informed engineering**. Every subsystem is designed so no single point of failure—technical, political, or cognitive—can break the civilization.

**"Revenge through creation."**

The three irreducible axioms in [CORE.md](CORE.md) define what this system **must** be:
1. **Flow Over Containment** - Stability through circulation, not accumulation
2. **Sovereignty via Forkability** - Exit rights over enforced unity
3. **Truth by Receipts** - Proof over authority

## A Note on Forkability

This project is **designed to be forked**. If you disagree with design decisions, governance approach, or philosophical foundation—fork it. Take the code, modify the architecture, build something better.

Success is not measured by how many people adopt *this exact version*. Success is measured by how many autonomous, thriving communities emerge—whether they use this blueprint verbatim or evolve it beyond recognition.

**The Sovereign Stack succeeds when it becomes unnecessary.**

**Status:** Version 0.1 - Design Phase  
**Last Updated:** January 2026  
**License:** Class A (Open Non-Commercial) / Class B (Controlled Commercial)

*"Flow over containment. Replication over scaling. Sovereignty as verb, not noun."*
