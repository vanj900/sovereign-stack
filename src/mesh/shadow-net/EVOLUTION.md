## Transformation from GhostLeach to Shadow-Net 2.0

### Original Vision
GhostLeach aimed to provide an anonymous and decentralized method for file sharing, focusing on user privacy and peer-to-peer communication.

### Problems with the Approach
1. **Legality Issues**: The original framework often fell into grey areas of copyright laws, risking legal actions.
2. **Scalability**: As the user base grew, performance issues emerged, leading to slower speeds and connectivity problems.
3. **User Experience**: Complex setups hindered user adoption, as many found it challenging to operate effectively.

### How Shadow-Net 2.0 Solves These Issues Legally
- **Compliance**: Shadow-Net 2.0 incorporates legal frameworks to ensure compliance with copyright laws, offering users a safer environment.
- **Enhanced Infrastructure**: Built to support increased traffic, improving speed and connectivity for users.
- **User Interface**: A more intuitive design that simplifies setup and usage, making it accessible to a broader audience.
