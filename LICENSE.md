# Sovereign Stack License v1.0 (February 2026)

The Sovereign Stack (software, Meshtastic LoRa bridge, deed-ledger ingest, governance chains, hardware blueprints (SOV-HAB, magnetic seismic tiles, water potability), AI advisors, Nostr relays, docs, and all related Materials — "the Project") is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License, Version 3 ("AGPL-3.0").

**Additional Sovereign Terms** (these supplement and control in case of conflict):

## 1. Goal

Empower individuals and small operators to fork, build, deploy, and monetize local cells without gatekeeping. Prevent large-scale corporate capture and profiteering that dilutes sovereignty.

## 2. Definitions

- **Small Operator**:
  - Natural persons (individuals), families, sole proprietors, partnerships, co-ops, non-profits, educational or research entities.
  - Any for-profit entity (LLC, corp, etc.) with **fewer than 20 full-time equivalent employees** AND **gross annual revenue under $1,000,000 USD** in its most recent completed fiscal year.
- **Large Entity**: Anyone or anything that is not a Small Operator.

## 3. Rights Granted

**To Small Operators**: Full AGPL-3.0 rights PLUS explicit commercial rights. You can freely:
- Manufacture, sell, or distribute hardware/products based on the blueprints.
- Offer paid services, consulting, installs, training, support, or hosted cells.
- Deploy, operate, and charge for local meshes, stacks, or derivatives.
- Fork and redistribute (must rename the project, keep full attribution + these terms unchanged).

Only requirements: Comply with AGPL-3.0 (full source for any distributed mods) and retain all notices.

**To Large Entities**: AGPL-3.0 rights granted **strictly for internal, non-commercial use only** (private testing/R&D, no customer-facing deployment, no manufacturing for resale, no paid services based on it).

Any commercial use, scaling, manufacturing, or profiteering requires a separate paid commercial license. Contact sovereign@ghoststack.dev. We may grant on reasonable terms (royalties, back-contributions, etc.) or deny if it risks enclosure. No exceptions for subsidiaries or workarounds.

## 4. Trademarks & Branding

"Sovereign Stack", "GhostStack", the glowing blue ghost logo, crossed swords, and related marks are reserved. Small Operators may use them in good faith with clear attribution. Large Entities may not. All derivatives/forks must use distinct branding to avoid confusion.

## 5. Anti-Capture

You may not remove, alter, or bypass these terms. Attempting to enclose, privatize, or dilute the commons terminates all rights. Violations will be publicly called out.

## 6. No Warranty

Everything "AS IS". Hardware use requires professional engineering/safety review. Consult experts. Not production-ready.

Build cells. Fork society. Stay sovereign. No central choke points — including the founder.
