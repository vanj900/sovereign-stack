## Overview

The Sovereign Stack is licensed under a **dual-class licensing model** designed to ensure maximum community benefit while protecting against extractive commercial exploitation.

- **Class A License** (Default): AGPL-3.0 for open non-commercial use
- **Class B License** (By Approval): Controlled commercial use with revenue sharing

All contributions to this project are subject to these licensing terms unless explicitly agreed otherwise in writing by O1 Labs CIC Directors.

## Class A License: Open Non-Commercial Use

### Grant of Rights

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Class A License, O1 Labs CIC grants you a **worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable license** to:

1. **Use** the Sovereign Stack for personal, educational, civic, or research purposes
2. **Study** the source code, documentation, and design specifications
3. **Modify** the materials for non-commercial purposes
4. **Fork** the project to create derivative autonomous communities
5. **Distribute** unmodified or modified copies, provided:
   - Attribution is maintained
   - This license accompanies all distributions
   - No commercial use occurs without Class B approval

### Permitted Use Cases

The following uses are **explicitly permitted** under Class A:

- **Personal deployment** (individuals or families building SOV-HABs for own use)
- **Community projects** (non-profit cooperative communities)
- **Educational institutions** (universities, schools, training programs)
- **Research organizations** (academic study, resilience infrastructure research)
- **Civic infrastructure** (local government pilot programs, disaster relief)
- **Open-source development** (contributing code, documentation, improvements)

### Restrictions

You **may not** under Class A:

- **Sell** access to Sovereign Stack infrastructure as a commercial service
- **Manufacture** SOV-HABs or components for commercial sale
- **License or sublicense** the Sovereign Stack to third parties for profit
- **Use trademarks** "Sovereign Stack," "SOV-HAB," "GhostStack," or "O1 Labs" in commercial products
- **Offer paid consulting** services based primarily on Sovereign Stack implementation (unless approved under Class B)
- **Incorporate into proprietary systems** that restrict user freedoms granted by this license

### Copyleft Requirement

Any modifications or derivative works distributed publicly **must**:

1. Be released under this same dual-license structure (Class A/B)
2. Make source code, designs, and documentation freely available
3. Provide clear attribution to the original Sovereign Stack project
4. Document all modifications in a `MODIFICATIONS.md` file

This ensures the community retains access to improvements while preventing proprietary capture.

---

## Class B License: Controlled Commercial Use

### Application Process

Commercial use requires **written approval** from O1 Labs CIC Directors. To apply:

1. Submit a **Commercial Use Application** to: [licensing@o1labs.community]
2. Include:
   - **Organization details** (legal entity, registration, jurisdiction)
   - **Intended use case** (specific products/services planned)
   - **Revenue model** (how you plan to monetize)
   - **Community benefit** (how your use advances Sovereign Stack goals)
   - **Pricing proposal** (if applicable—see Revenue Sharing below)

### Evaluation Criteria

Applications are evaluated against:

- **Alignment with Sovereign Stack principles** (flow over containment, community sovereignty)
- **Potential harm** (risk of extractive exploitation, vendor lock-in, centralization)
- **Community benefit** (does commercialization advance autonomous community adoption?)
- **Resource sustainability** (can O1 Labs CIC support this use case?)

O1 Labs CIC reserves the right to **deny any application** that conflicts with the Community Interest Company's asset lock or mission.

### Commercial Use Cases

Examples of uses requiring Class B approval:

- **SOV-HAB manufacturing** for sale to third parties
- **Turnkey community deployment** services (consulting, construction, training)
- **Proprietary software platforms** integrating GhostStack or Energy Coupler protocols
- **Franchising or licensing** the Sovereign Stack brand/methodology
- **Government contracts** deploying Sovereign Stack infrastructure
- **Corporate pilot programs** using Sovereign Stack for employee housing or operations

### Revenue Sharing

Class B licenses **may include** revenue sharing arrangements:

- **Default rate**: 5-15% of gross revenue from Sovereign Stack-derived products/services
- **Sliding scale**: Higher percentages for purely extractive use; lower for community-aligned ventures
- **Waived fees**: For organizations demonstrating exceptional community benefit

All Class B revenue is reinvested in Sovereign Stack development, community support, and open-source infrastructure per O1 Labs CIC's asset lock.

### Revocation

Class B licenses may be **revoked** if:

- Terms are violated (non-payment, misrepresentation, trademark abuse)
- Use becomes harmful (surveillance, coercion, centralized control)
- Organization changes in ways incompatible with original approval (acquisition by extractive entity)

Revocation requires 90 days' written notice unless egregious violations occur.

---

## Attribution Requirements

All distributions (Class A or B) must include:

1. **Copyright notice**: "Based on Sovereign Stack by O1 Labs CIC"
2. **License reference**: Link to this LICENSE.md file
3. **Modification notice**: If altered, state "Modified from original Sovereign Stack design"
4. **No endorsement**: Do not imply O1 Labs CIC endorses your derivative work without written permission

### Trademark Usage

Use requires:
- **Descriptive use** (Class A): "Built using Sovereign Stack technology" ✓

---

## Forking and Community Autonomy

The Sovereign Stack is **designed to be forked**. Forking is encouraged when:

- Communities wish to diverge in design philosophy
- Regional adaptations require incompatible changes
- Governance disputes make collaboration untenable

### Fork Requirements

Forked projects must:

1. **Change the name** (cannot use "Sovereign Stack" or related trademarks)
2. **Maintain attribution** to the original project
3. **Adopt compatible licensing** (dual-class or more permissive, not less)
4. **Document divergence** (explain how/why the fork differs)

Forks **inherit Class A rights** automatically. Class B rights do not transfer (new commercial approvals required).

## Hardware and Physical Designs

This license applies to:

- **CAD files and blueprints** (SOV-HAB designs, MLDT specifications)
- **Circuit diagrams** (Energy Coupler, mesh network hardware)

Physical instantiations (built SOV-HABs, fabricated components) are the property of their builders, subject to:

- **Personal use** (Class A): Build for yourself/community freely
- **Commercial manufacture** (Class B): Requires approval for sale to others

## Software Components
