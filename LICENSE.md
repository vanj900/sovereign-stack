**Forking Policy**  
Forking is not just allowed — it's encouraged.  
Every fork **must**:
- Use a completely different project name
- Clearly state "Fork of sovereign-stack by vanj900"
- Link back to https://github.com/vanj900/sovereign-stack
- Keep this full license file unchanged

**Attribution**  
vanj900 must be visibly credited as the original author in all derivatives.

**This license exists to keep the stack forkable and sovereign.**  
If you try to capture or dilute it, you will be denied Class B and publicly called out.

Flow over containment. Replication over scaling. Sovereignty as verb, not noun.
