# 02_System_Protocols: Operations

**How cells cooperate. How crisis is handled. How defense works. How trauma is processed.**

---

## Purpose

This section documents the **operational protocols** that govern day-to-day functioning, crisis response, conflict resolution, and inter-cell coordination.

---

## Core Protocols

### Cell Cooperation
**File:** `cell-cooperation.md` (coming soon)

- Inter-cell communication (mesh protocols)
- Resource sharing (energy, water, knowledge)
- Mutual aid frameworks (crisis support between cells)
- Interoperability standards (fork-compatible protocols)

### Crisis Handling
**File:** `crisis-handling.md` (coming soon)

- Emergency escalation procedures
- Resource allocation during scarcity
- Communication protocols (when infrastructure fails)
- Evacuation and relocation plans

### Defense Protocols
**File:** `defense-protocols.md` (coming soon)

- Non-lethal defense mesh (sensors, alarms, documentation)
- NVEP (Node Veto Escalation Protocol)
- Legal defense frameworks (transparency as protection)
- Exit protocols (safe relocation procedures)

### Remediation Pipelines
**File:** `remediation-pipelines.md` (coming soon)

- Conflict resolution (graduated escalation)
- Restorative justice workflows
- Therapeutic integration (GhostBrain crisis support)
- Harm repair frameworks (community healing)

---

## Governance Protocols

### Proposal Workflow
**File:** `proposal-workflow.md` (coming soon)

1. **Draft:** Anyone can create a proposal
2. **Discussion:** Community provides feedback
3. **Vote:** Threshold determined by cell
4. **Execute:** If passed, action is taken
5. **Receipt:** Cryptographic proof generated

### Fork Protocol
**File:** `fork-protocol.md` (coming soon)

- Fork initiation (any node can trigger)
- Fork Manifest (documents divergence)
- Resource allocation (how assets split)
- Ongoing interoperability (maintain or break communication)

### Consensus Mechanisms
**File:** `consensus-mechanisms.md` (coming soon)

- Simple majority
- Supermajority (2/3, 3/4)
- Consensus-minus-one
- Delegated decision-making (temporary authority)

---

## Communication Protocols

### Mesh Routing
**File:** `mesh-routing.md` (coming soon)

- Node discovery
- Message routing (peer-to-peer)
- Encryption standards
- Fallback mechanisms (when nodes fail)

### Data Synchronization
**File:** `data-synchronization.md` (coming soon)

- CRDT (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types)
- Eventual consistency
- Partition tolerance
- Conflict resolution

---

## Contributing to This Section

We need:
- Detailed protocol specifications
- Real-world case studies (conflicts resolved, crises handled)
- Stress testing results
- Failure mode analysis

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

→ **[04_Implementation](../04_Implementation/)** - Building and deploying
