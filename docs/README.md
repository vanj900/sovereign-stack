# Documentation

**A walkable path from "What is this?" to "How do I build it?"**

---

## Essential Reading

**Start here:** [CORE.md](../CORE.md) - The three irreducible axioms that define the Sovereign Stack's architecture and philosophy. Understanding these principles is essential for all other documentation.

**Then read:**
- [NON_GOALS.md](../NON_GOALS.md) - What we refuse to become (the four boundaries)
- [STATUS.md](../STATUS.md) - Current project phase and progress

---

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized as a **progressive path**—each section builds on the previous one.

### [00_Foundation](00_Foundation/) - Philosophy & Context

**"Why does this exist? What crisis does it solve?"**

- Crisis context (institutional failure patterns)
- Philosophical framework (sovereignty, flow, receipts)
- Cultural axioms ("No thrones, no heirs")
- Manifesto ("Revenge through creation")

**Start here if:** You're new and want to understand the "why"

---

### [01_Core_Architecture](01_Core_Architecture/) - System Design

**"How is the system designed? What are the five layers?"**

- The five layers (Energy, Mesh, GhostStack, GhostBrain, Physical)
- GhostStack (governance engine)
- GhostBrain (AI advisor, NVEP)
- Longevity protocol (how the system persists)
- Security architecture

**Start here if:** You understand the philosophy and want technical overview

---

### [02_System_Protocols](02_System_Protocols/) - Operations

**"How do cells cooperate? How is crisis handled?"**

- Cell cooperation (inter-cell communication)
- Crisis handling (emergency protocols)
- Defense protocols (non-violent, NVEP)
- Remediation pipelines (restorative justice)
- Governance protocols (proposals, forks, consensus)

**Start here if:** You're building a cell and need operational guidelines

---

### [03_Living_Meshes](03_Living_Meshes/) - Subsystems

**"How does energy flow? How is food produced?"**

- Energy flow (solar, battery, Energy Coupler)
- Food production (regenerative agriculture)
- Water independence (harvesting, treatment)
- Health systems (decentralized clinical cells)
- Learning networks (Essential 13, skill receipts)

**Start here if:** You're implementing specific subsystems

---

### [04_Implementation](04_Implementation/) - Building

**"How do I actually build this? Where's the code?"**

- Code architecture (repos, tech stack, dev environment)
- SOV-HAB construction (BOM, assembly, legal)
- MLDT sensors (specifications, installation)
- Energy Coupler (hardware, software, grid integration)
- Cognitive Exoskeleton (personal AI setup)

**Start here if:** You're ready to build and need practical guides

---

## Legacy Directories

The following directories are being migrated into the new structure:

- `builders/` → Moving to [04_Implementation](04_Implementation/)
- `governance/` → Moving to [02_System_Protocols](02_System_Protocols/)
- `legal/` → Moving to [00_Foundation](00_Foundation/) and [04_Implementation](04_Implementation/)
- `research/` → Cross-referenced across all sections
- `technical/` → Moving to [01_Core_Architecture](01_Core_Architecture/)

3. **[00_Foundation](00_Foundation/)** (30 min) - Learn the philosophy
4. **[01_Core_Architecture](01_Core_Architecture/)** (1 hour) - Grasp the system design
5. **[STATUS.md](../STATUS.md)** (10 min) - See current progress

### If you're a developer:

1. **[CORE.md](../CORE.md)** (15 min) - Understand constraints
2. **[01_Core_Architecture](01_Core_Architecture/)** (1 hour) - Learn architecture
3. **[04_Implementation](04_Implementation/)** (as needed) - Start coding

### If you're a builder:

1. **[CORE.md](../CORE.md)** (15 min) - Understand principles
2. **[04_Implementation](04_Implementation/)** (as needed) - Build guides

2. **[01_Core_Architecture](01_Core_Architecture/)** (1 hour) - System design
3. **Research papers** (cross-referenced in each section)

### If you're skeptical:

1. **[NON_GOALS.md](../NON_GOALS.md)** (10 min) - See what we're NOT claiming
2. **[CORE.md](../CORE.md)** (15 min) - Understand the constraints
3. **GitHub Discussions** - Ask questions

## Contributing Documentation

We need help with:

1. **Writing guides** - Turn specifications into step-by-step instructions
2. **Creating diagrams** - Visualize system architecture and flows
3. **Testing instructions** - Follow guides and report what works/doesn't
4. **Translating** - Make documentation accessible in other languages
5. **Case studies** - Document real-world implementations

### Documentation Standards

- **Format:** Markdown (.md) for text, SVG for diagrams
- **Naming:** Use kebab-case (like-this.md)
- **Structure:** Start with overview, then details
- **Links:** Use relative paths for internal links
- **Images:** Store in `/docs/assets/images/`

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.
