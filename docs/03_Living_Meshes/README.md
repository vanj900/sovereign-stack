# 03_Living_Meshes: Subsystems

**Energy flow. Food production. Water independence. Health systems. Learning networks.**

---

## Purpose

This section documents the **regenerative subsystems** that enable community autonomy and resilience.

---

## Subsystems

### Energy Flow
**File:** `energy-flow.md` (coming soon)

- Solar power systems (1.2kW per SOV-HAB)
- Battery storage (5kWh, 2-3 days autonomy)
- Energy Coupler (bidirectional grid interface)
- Peer-to-peer energy routing (surplus sharing)
- AI-mediated reciprocity (fair distribution algorithms)

### Food Production
**File:** `food-production.md` (coming soon)

- AI-managed polyculture (soil-first regeneration)
- Closed-loop nutrients (composting, biochar)
- 30% food self-sufficiency target (Phase 3)
- Mesh-coordinated resource sharing

### Water Independence
**File:** `water-independence.md` (coming soon)

- Rainwater harvesting (collection systems)
- Greywater recycling (treatment protocols)
- Chain-of-Potability (quality receipts)
- Mesh-routed water quality monitoring

### Health Systems
**File:** `health-systems.md` (coming soon)

- Decentralized clinical cells (community health workers)
- Vitality credits (preventative care incentives)
- Federated learning (privacy-preserving health data)
- GhostBrain therapeutic integration

### Learning Networks
**File:** `learning-networks.md` (coming soon)

- Essential 13 (minimum competencies for autonomy)
- Skill-based learning receipts
- Mentorship as civic duty
- Cross-cell knowledge sharing (mesh-enabled education)

## Integration Points

All subsystems integrate with:
- **GhostStack:** Receipts track resource flows
- **GhostBrain:** AI optimizes resource allocation
- **Sovereign Mesh:** Data synchronization across cells
- **Energy Coupler:** Power routing prioritizes critical systems

## Contributing to This Section

We need:
- Technical specifications for each subsystem
- BOM (Bill of Materials) for hardware
- Performance benchmarks
- Real-world deployment case studies

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

## Next Steps

→ **[04_Implementation](../04_Implementation/)** - Building and deploying
