The Sovereign Stack has clear boundaries. These define what the system **refuses to become**, protecting it from mission drift, capture, and corruption.

---

## 1. Not a Government

**The Sovereign Stack does not seek to replace, reform, or recognize existing state structures.**

### What This Means

- **No central authority**: There is no "Sovereign Stack Inc." controlling all nodes
- **No territorial sovereignty**: Communities exist **parallel** to states, not as rival governments
- **No monopoly on force**: Defense is non-violent and decentralized (see NVEP in protocols)
- **No diplomatic recognition**: We don't ask permission from states to exist

### Why This Boundary Exists

Governments centralize power by claiming exclusive legitimacy. The moment the Sovereign Stack becomes "a government," it:
- Creates a throne (violates Sovereignty via Forkability)
- Requires enforcement (violates Truth by Receipts)
- Stops energy flow through bureaucracy (violates Flow Over Containment)

### What We Do Instead

- **Exist alongside states**: Pay taxes where required, follow laws that don't violate core principles
- **Exercise exit rights**: Communities can leave jurisdictions that become hostile
- **Build redundancy**: If one cell is shut down by a state, others continue independently

**If someone proposes:** "Let's register as a new nation" → **Reject**. That's not sovereignty; that's seeking external validation.

## 2. Not an AI Ruler

**AI advises. Humans decide. Always.**

### What This Means

- **GhostBrain is a tool**, not an authority
- **Humans retain veto power** at all times (Node Veto Escalation Protocol - NVEP)
- **AI cannot enforce decisions**: No autonomous sanctions, no algorithmic punishment
- **Transparency required**: All AI recommendations must be explainable

### Why This Boundary Exists

The moment humans delegate authority to AI, they:
- Outsource responsibility (violates Truth by Receipts)
- Create unaccountable power (violates Sovereignty via Forkability)
- Stop participating in governance (violates the "verb" in sovereignty)

### What We Do Instead

- **GhostBrain as advisor**: Provides context, simulations, historical precedents
- **Humans make final calls**: Every consequential decision requires human confirmation
- **NVEP escalation**: If AI recommendations seem harmful, humans can override and escalate to wider community review
- **Continuous human-in-the-loop**: AI learns from human decisions, doesn't replace them

**If someone proposes:** "Let AI optimize governance automatically" → **Reject**. Optimization is how you get authoritarianism with better UX.

## 3. Not a Weapon

**The Sovereign Stack is designed for defense, not conquest.**

### What This Means

- **Non-lethal by design**: Defense protocols use deterrence, not violence
- **No offensive capability**: Cannot be weaponized for aggression
- **Mesh architecture limits attack surface**: Decentralization makes the stack hard to capture but also hard to weaponize
- **Transparent protocols**: All defense mechanisms are documented and auditable

### Why This Boundary Exists

Systems designed for violence attract violent people. The moment the Sovereign Stack becomes "a weapon," it:
- Invites state suppression (violates operational security)
- Creates hierarchies of force (violates cell structure)
- Justifies preemptive violence (violates non-aggression principle)

### What We Do Instead

- **Deterrence through resilience**: Hard to attack because there's no central point of failure
- **Non-violent defense mesh**: Sensors, alarms, documentation—not weapons
- **Legal and social defense**: Transparency, public documentation, community solidarity
- **Exit as ultimate defense**: If a location becomes hostile, the cell relocates or forks

**If someone proposes:** "Let's add autonomous weapons for defense" → **Reject**. That's how defense systems become offense systems.

## 4. Not a Utopia

**The Sovereign Stack is designed to be anti-fragile, not painless.**

### What This Means

- **Conflict is expected**: The system handles disagreement through forking, not suppression
- **Friction is productive**: Challenges strengthen the system (anti-fragility)
- **No guarantee of happiness**: The system provides sovereignty, not bliss
- **Failure is local**: Individual cells can fail without collapsing the entire network

### Why This Boundary Exists

Utopian projects promise perfection and deliver authoritarianism. The moment the Sovereign Stack becomes "a utopia," it:
- Eliminates productive dissent (violates Sovereignty via Forkability)
- Creates brittle systems (violates anti-fragility principle)
- Attracts ideologues who can't handle reality (violates pragmatic resilience)

### What We Do Instead

- **Design for stress**: Systems are tested under adversarial conditions
- **Embrace forking**: Disagreement leads to diversity, not schism
- **Learn from failure**: Each local failure informs system-wide improvements
- **Build for reality**: Plan for resource scarcity, interpersonal conflict, technical breakdown

**If someone proposes:** "Let's eliminate all conflict" → **Reject**. That's not peace; that's suppression.

## Why These Boundaries Matter

These four non-goals protect the Sovereign Stack from **predictable failure modes**:

### Protects Against Scaling

**Threat:** VCs or states wanting to "scale" the system vertically
- "Not a Government" → Prevents state capture
- "Not an AI Ruler" → Prevents algorithmic authoritarianism
- Cell structure forces horizontal replication, not vertical hierarchy

### Protects Against Capture

**Threat:** Commercial interests wanting to "productize" autonomy
- "Not a Weapon" → Prevents military-industrial capture
- "Not a Utopia" → Prevents cult-like ideological capture
- Asset Lock ensures revenue serves community benefit

### Protects Against Militarization

**Threat:** Doomers wanting to arm the system for "protection"
- "Not a Weapon" → Hard constraint against offense capability
- "Not a Government" → No monopoly on force
- Defense mesh is transparent and non-lethal

### Protects Against Ideological Rigidity

**Threat:** Idealists wanting to eliminate all friction
- "Not a Utopia" → Embraces productive conflict
- Forkability allows divergence without schism
- Anti-fragility requires stress testing

## What Happens If You Violate These Boundaries

### If you make it a government:
→ Central authority emerges
→ Power accumulates instead of flowing
→ Exit rights erode
→ **The stack breaks**

### If you make AI the ruler:
→ Humans stop participating
→ Accountability becomes opaque
→ Sovereignty becomes passive
→ **The stack breaks**

### If you make it a weapon:
→ States preemptively suppress it
→ Hierarchies of force emerge
→ Communities lose trust
→ **The stack breaks**

### If you make it a utopia:
→ Systems become brittle
→ Dissent is suppressed
→ Reality breaks the illusion
→ **The stack breaks**

## How to Enforce These Boundaries

### Technical Constraints

- **Cell size limit (3-7 nodes)**: Prevents government-scale hierarchy
- **NVEP (Node Veto Escalation Protocol)**: Ensures humans override AI
- **Non-lethal defense mesh**: No weapons integration by design
- **Forkability**: Allows exit from toxic ideologies

### Social Constraints

- **License terms (AGPL-3.0 + Asset Lock)**: Prevents commercial weaponization
- **Community governance**: Forks reject proposals that violate boundaries
- **Transparent documentation**: Public accountability for design decisions
- **Philosophy alignment in contributions**: See CONTRIBUTING.md

### Cultural Constraints

- **"No thrones, no heirs"**: Cultural rejection of centralization
- **"Verify, don't trust"**: Cultural rejection of unaccountable power
- **"Fork, don't fight"**: Cultural embrace of productive dissent
- **"Anti-fragile, not painless"**: Cultural acceptance of conflict

## Questions About Non-Goals

### "Can't we just add [feature that violates a non-goal] as optional?"

**No.** Optional features become default through path dependence. If weaponization is "optional," someone will weaponize it.

### "What if AI genuinely makes better decisions than humans?"

Then humans should **adopt those decisions**—but the choice must remain with humans. The moment AI decides autonomously, accountability disappears.

### "What if a hostile state tries to shut us down?"

That's why we're **not a government**. We don't need state recognition. If one jurisdiction becomes hostile, cells relocate or continue operations elsewhere. The network persists.

### "Isn't 'not a utopia' defeatist?"

No. It's realistic. Utopian projects fail because they can't handle friction. Anti-fragile systems **thrive** on stress. This is a feature, not a bug.

## Living Document Status

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Core boundaries (immutable)
**Last Updated:** January 22, 2026

These boundaries are as non-negotiable as the axioms in CORE.md. They define what the Sovereign Stack **refuses to become**.

Proposed changes to NON_GOALS.md require:
1. Demonstration that the boundary creates more harm than good
2. Proof that removing it doesn't enable predictable failure modes
3. Approval from O1 Labs CIC Directors
4. Community discussion period (minimum 90 days)

**If you disagree with these boundaries, fork the project.** That is their purpose.
